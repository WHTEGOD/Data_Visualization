# Vehicle Data Visualization with Python 🚗📊

Welcome to the Vehicle Data Visualization project! This repository showcases various data visualizations created using Python libraries including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The visualizations explore insights into vehicle data, such as MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price), engine horsepower, and vehicle popularity.

## The Data Used is just for demostration of the skills learned.

## Visualizations

Here’s what you’ll find in this project:

1. **Bar Graph:** 📉 Average MSRP by Vehicle Size
2. **Histogram:** 📊 Distribution of Engine HP
3. **Pie Chart:** 🥧 Distribution of Vehicle Sizes
4. **Line Graph:** 📈 Highway MPG Over the Years by Driven Wheels
5. **Scatter Plot:** 🔍 Engine Cylinders vs. Popularity
6. **Bubble Chart:** 💬 Engine HP vs. MSRP with Bubble Size Based on Popularity
7. **Violin Plot:** 🎻 Distribution of MSRP by Vehicle Size
8. **Box Plot:** 📦 Distribution of Engine HP by Vehicle Size
9. **Area Chart:** 📉 Cumulative Count of Vehicles Over the Years
10. **Tree Map:** 🌳 Count of Vehicle Styles by Make
